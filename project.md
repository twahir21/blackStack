# 📘 Passenger Information System (PIS) Documentation

## **1. Project Overview**

The **Passenger Information System** provides real-time bus schedule updates, including departure, arrival, and status (on-time/delayed).
Key components:

* **Frontend (Qwik or Next.js)** → Public-facing display (station monitors, mobile web).
* **Backend (Elysia + Bun)** → REST API / GraphQL API for schedules, buses, stations.
* **Database (Postgres + Drizzle ORM)** → Store buses, routes, stations, and schedules.
* **Admin Dashboard (Next.js or Qwik)** → For operators to add, edit, and monitor bus schedules.

---

## **2. Phases of Development**

### **Phase 1: Planning & Design**

* Gather requirements (which stations, how many buses, user roles).
* Create **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** for DB.
* Finalize UI mockups (frontend + admin).

**Deliverables:** Wireframes, DB schema, project roadmap.

---

### **Phase 2: Backend Development**

* Setup **Elysia + Bun** server.
* Setup **Drizzle ORM** with Postgres.
* Implement API endpoints:

  * `GET /buses` → all buses with status
  * `GET /buses/:id` → specific bus details
  * `POST /buses` → add a new bus (admin only)
  * `PUT /buses/:id` → update status/schedule
  * `DELETE /buses/:id` → remove bus

**Deliverables:** Working backend API with auth + validation.

---

### **Phase 3: Database Setup**

* Tables (Postgres + Drizzle migrations):

  * **users** (id, username, password\_hash, role)
  * **buses** (id, plate\_no, from\_city, to\_city, station\_id)
  * **stations** (id, name, location)
  * **schedules** (id, bus\_id, departure, arrival, status)

**Deliverables:** Database schema + migrations.

---

### **Phase 4: Admin Dashboard**

* Built with **Next.js (recommended for ecosystem)** or **Qwik (if you want resumability speed)**.
* Features:

  * Login/logout (JWT/Auth).
  * Manage buses, routes, schedules.
  * View reports (delays, departures).

**Deliverables:** Secure admin panel with CRUD features.

---

### **Phase 5: Public Frontend (Display System)**

* Use **Qwik/Next.js + Tailwind** for responsive UI.
* Live update from backend via **WebSocket / SSE**.
* Show bus timetable like your prototype.

**Deliverables:** Public display site that auto-refreshes in real-time.

---

### **Phase 6: Testing & Deployment**

* Unit tests for backend APIs.
* Integration tests for admin actions.
* Deploy backend on a VPS (Bun + Postgres).
* Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify or Docker container).

**Deliverables:** Production-ready system.

### **💰 Budget Allocation (Estimated)**  
| **Component**      | **Cost Range (TZS)**   | **Notes**                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Backend Development| 300,000 – 400,000     | API logic, auth, DB integration           |
| Frontend Development| 250,000 – 350,000    | Admin dashboard + passenger UI             |
| Database Setup     | 100,000 – 150,000     | PostgreSQL hosting, migrations            |
| Deployment         | 50,000 – 100,000      | VPS/Cloud costs (Bun + Postgres)          |
| Contingency        | 100,000 – 200,000     | Unplanned adjustments, testing fixes      |
| **Total**          | **800,000 – 1,200,000** | Scalable based on feature refinements    |

---

### **🔑 Key Notes**  
- **Assumptions**: Solo developer, basic admin features, single deployment environment.  
- **Flexibility**: Budget can adjust for additional features (e.g., real-time alerts, mobile app).  
- **Cost-Savers**: Open-source stack (Bun, Postgres) avoids licensing fees.  

--- 

### **📝 Stakeholder Recommendations**  
1. **Prioritize**: Core features (schedule tracking, admin controls) within the 1-week timeline.  
2. **Scale Later**: Add real-time updates (WebSockets) post-launch if budget allows.  
3. **Hosting**: Use affordable VPS providers (e.g., DigitalOcean, Hetzner).  

Let me know if you'd like a **visual Gantt chart** or **risk assessment** to accompany this! 🚀

## **4. Tech Stack Summary**

* **Backend:** Bun + Elysia (fast, modern, lightweight).
* **Database:** Postgres + Drizzle ORM (safe, type-checked).
* **Frontend (Public):** Qwik or Next.js (with TailwindCSS).
* **Admin Panel:** Next.js/Qwik (with TailwindCSS).
* **Deployment:** VPS (Yatosha VPS Tanzania) or local Tanzanian host.

Great question 🚀 — you’ve already done **an excellent job** preparing this documentation. It’s clean, structured, and investor/stakeholder-ready.
But you’re right: **scope** and a few refinements are missing. Let me break this down into **what’s missing** and **what can be improved/removed**:

---

## ✅ What’s Missing (Should Be Added)

1. **📌 Project Scope** (VERY important)

   * Defines what’s included **and what’s not included** in this 1-week, 800k–1.2M TZS budget.
   * Example:

     * **In Scope**: Bus CRUD, schedules, admin dashboard, passenger display UI.
     * **Out of Scope** (future versions): Mobile app, advanced analytics, SMS/email notifications, payment system.
       👉 Without this, clients may **assume you’re delivering more than budget allows**.

2. **🎯 Objectives / Goals**

   * Why are we building this system? (e.g., reduce delays, improve passenger experience, digitize bus management).
   * Keeps the project aligned with stakeholder expectations.

3. **👥 User Roles & Permissions**

   * Define who uses the system and their access level:

     * **Admin**: Full CRUD (buses, schedules).
     * **Operator**: Can update schedule statuses.
     * **Passenger**: Read-only (view schedules).
   * Prevents scope creep later.

4. **⚠️ Risks & Mitigation**

   * Example:

     * Risk: “Unstable internet at stations.” → Mitigation: offline-first caching.
     * Risk: “VPS downtime.” → Mitigation: automated backups.
   * Shows professionalism and foresight.

5. **📈 Success Metrics (KPIs)**

   * Example:

     * Passenger UI loads < 2s.
     * 99% uptime.
     * Schedule update propagation < 5s.
   * Gives measurable criteria for project completion.

---

## 🔄 What Could Be Improved / Refined

* **Budget Table**:
  Already great 👌 but you could also include % allocation (e.g., Backend 35%, Frontend 30%, etc.) for more clarity.

* **Timeline Table**:
  Consider showing **parallel tasks** instead of strictly sequential (backend can start in Day 1 with DB). Makes it more realistic.

---

## 🗑️ What Can Be Removed (Not Needed in Lean Doc)

* **Over-detailed endpoint list** (`GET /buses/:id`, etc.).

  * Instead: summarize → “Backend exposes CRUD APIs for buses, routes, and schedules.”
  * Detailed API spec should be a **separate technical doc**.

* **Too many frontend framework options** (Qwik/Next.js).

  * Pick **one recommended** (Next.js is safer for ecosystem) → mentioning both may confuse non-technical stakeholders.

---

## 📝 Suggested Section Order (for best flow)

1. Project Overview
2. Scope (in & out)
3. Objectives / Success Metrics
4. Tech Stack Summary
5. Phases (with tables)
6. Budget (with tables + % allocation)
7. Risks & Mitigation
8. Deployment Plan
9. Recommendations / Next Steps

---

👉 In short:

* You **missed scope & objectives**.
* You **could simplify API/tech options**.
* Adding **risks, KPIs, and scope boundaries** will make your doc look like a **professional consultancy-grade proposal**.

---

Would you like me to **rewrite your doc** in this improved structure (with scope, risks, KPIs added and redundant stuff cleaned) — so it’s pitch-ready for investors/clients?
